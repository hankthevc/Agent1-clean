# Trivia System Integration Documentation

## Overview

The Trivia Tiles game now features a complete trivia progression system that adds a narrative layer to the word puzzle gameplay. Players unlock clues progressively as they find more words, culminating in a final trivia challenge.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **TriviaClue Component** (`/client/src/components/TriviaClue.tsx`)
   - Displays progressive clues based on puzzle progress
   - Shows locked/unlocked states with visual feedback
   - Provides progress indicators

2. **FinalTrivia Component** (`/client/src/components/FinalTrivia.tsx`)
   - Presents the final trivia question
   - Handles answer submission and validation
   - Offers hint system with previously shown clues
   - Allows retry on incorrect answers

3. **App Component Integration** (`/client/src/App.tsx`)
   - Manages trivia state and progression
   - Calculates unlock thresholds
   - Triggers final trivia at 90% completion

### Data Flow

```
Puzzle Progress → Unlock Thresholds → Clue Visibility → Final Trivia
     ↓                    ↓                   ↓              ↓
Found Words        25/40/60/80%         Progressive      90% Trigger
                                         Display
```

## Progression System

### Clue Unlocking
- **25% Progress**: First clue unlocked (general hint)
- **40% Progress**: Second clue unlocked (more specific)
- **60% Progress**: Third clue unlocked (narrowing down)
- **80% Progress**: Fourth clue unlocked (final hint)

### Final Trivia
- **90% Progress**: Final trivia question appears automatically
- Players can dismiss and continue finding words
- Trivia can be attempted multiple times

## State Management

### Key States
```typescript
const [showFinalTrivia, setShowFinalTrivia] = useState(false);
const [triviaCompleted, setTriviaCompleted] = useState(false);
```

### Progress Calculation
```typescript
const progress = foundWords.length / puzzleData.validWords.length;
const unlockedCluesCount = TRIVIA_UNLOCK_THRESHOLDS.filter(
  threshold => progress >= threshold
).length;
```
